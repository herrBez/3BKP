# Extensions of the 3BKP
The three-dimensional knapsack problem with balancing constraint is an 
optimization problem described in 
[Baldi et al](http://porto.polito.it/2464177/1/2464177.pdf).


In this repository you can find:
1. a CPLEX implementation of this model under the folder 3BKP/.
2. a CPLEX implementaion of an extended model with multiple Knapsacks (Multi3BKP/).
3. a CPLEX implementation of an extension of the 3BKP, that tries to find the minimum
Knapsacks dimensions that contain all the given items (SmallHull/).
4. a WebGL program that gives a 3D representation of the program's output
5. Some Instances and an instance generator (MultiInstance/)
6. A benchmark script and an RScript to generate latex tables of the results 
obtained by the benchmark
7. A report written in Italian
